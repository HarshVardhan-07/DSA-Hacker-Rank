This repositroy contains all the problems related to algorithms which are on Hacker rank.
I tried to make the code solution self explanatory by adding comments and writing the approch which I used to solve the problem. If you are a expirienced coder please let me know if the statments written in the commnets are correct or not. Your help will be highly appriciate.
Feel free to take a look and if possible suggest the ways to imporve my coding and if there is any optimization which can be done.
If you are doing this on Hacker Rank the order of the question might be different. The name of the files and the challenge name is the same so it won't be difficult for you to check my solution.
